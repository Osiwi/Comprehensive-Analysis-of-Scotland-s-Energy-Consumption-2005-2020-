# Comprehensive Analysis of Scotland Energy Consumption (2005-2020)
This project delivers a full-scale data analysis and dashboard visualization of Scotland’s energy consumption patterns from 2005 to 2020 across all 32 council areas. It investigates how different sectors and energy types have evolved over time, supporting sustainability planning and policy recommendations.

**Title:**
 [Comprehensive Analysis of Scotland's Energy Consumption (2005–2020)](https://github.com/Osiwi/Comprehensive-Analysis-of-Scotland-s-Energy-Consumption-2005-2020-/blob/main/DataKirk%20Data%20Analysis%20and%20Insight_17072025.xlsx)

**Tools & Technologies Used:**
Excel – for initial data cleaning, exploration/exploratory data analysis and interactive data visualization
Government Dataset Source – Scottish Government: Annual energy consumption by council area

**Project Description Overview:**
This project delivers a full-scale data analysis and dashboard visualization of Scotland’s energy consumption patterns from 2005 to 2020 across all 32 council areas. It investigates how different sectors and energy types have evolved over time, supporting sustainability planning and policy recommendations.

**Objective:**
To uncover actionable insights into:
Regional energy demand
Energy source transitions (e.g., coal phase-out, renewable growth)
Sector-specific energy consumption patterns
Opportunities for policy intervention in energy efficiency and sustainable development

**Key Features Included in the Dashboard:**
Total Energy Consumption Over Time (2005–2020):
Shows declining energy trends and policy impacts

Top Sectoral Energy Use:
Comparison across Domestic, Industrial, Commercial, and Transport sectors

Energy Type Breakdown (Pie Chart):
Proportional usage of Gas, Electricity, Petroleum Products, Coal, Renewables, etc.

Sector vs. Energy Type Cross-Analysis:
Highlights which sectors depend on which fuel types (e.g., road transport on petroleum)

Coal Phase-Out Analysis:
A downward trend line showing Scotland's transition from coal

Renewable Energy Growth (Bioenergy & Wastes):
Visualizes the steady growth of sustainable sources

Regional Insights:
Council-wise breakdown of energy demand (e.g., Falkirk, Glasgow City)

**Interactive Slicers and Filters:**
Council Area
Year (Date Code)
Energy Type
Sector (e.g., Domestic, Transport, Industrial)
These filters allow users to drill down into specific insights per region or energy form.

**Key Findings:**
Overall decline in total energy consumption since 2005, suggesting policy effectiveness or population/industrial shifts.
Coal usage significantly decreased, validating Scotland’s coal phase-out policies.
Petroleum Products and Gas remain dominant, especially in transport and industrial sectors.
Renewable energy (Bioenergy & Wastes) shows gradual but positive growth.
Falkirk and Glasgow are among the highest energy-consuming regions, indicating concentrated industrial or urban demands.
